# List and Table Screen Design Guidelines

This document is the required layout contract for every list or table screen in Kovia.

## Goals

- Use the full width and the full remaining height of the application content area.
- Keep the page heading and list toolbar visible above the data region.
- Keep pagination anchored to the bottom of the list container.
- Scroll only the table/list body when rows exceed the available height.
- Keep the layout stable across common viewport sizes and browser zoom levels.
- Preserve a full-height data surface even when there are only a few rows.

## Required structure

```tsx
<div className="flex h-full min-h-0 min-w-0 flex-1 flex-col gap-4">
  <header className="shrink-0">...</header>

  <OperationalListPanel aria-label="Danh sách ...">
    <div className="shrink-0 border-b">...</div> {/* title and filters */}
    <Table>...</Table>                            {/* flexible scrolling body */}
    <OperationalPagination ... />                 {/* pinned footer */}
  </OperationalListPanel>
</div>
```

Use `OperationalListPanel` from `src/components/operations/OperationalListPanel.tsx`. Do not copy its height or overflow classes into feature screens.

## Width and workspace rules

1. The private application shell keeps the sidebar at its configured width and gives the main area `flex-1 min-w-0`.
2. Every wrapper from the main area to the page root uses `w-full min-w-0`.
3. Operational list/table pages must not use `container`, `mx-auto`, `max-w-*`, fixed pixel widths, or `justify-center` on their workspace wrappers.
4. Responsive horizontal padding belongs to the shared private content shell; feature pages must not add a second centered container.
5. Width limits remain valid for focused forms, dialogs, print views, authentication, public landing pages, and readable detail content when they are not the primary operational list workspace.
6. Expanding the workspace must not scale typography, buttons, inputs, or other controls.

## Height and scrolling rules

1. Every ancestor between the application content shell and the list panel must allow flex children to shrink with `min-h-0`.
2. The page root uses `h-full min-h-0 flex-1 flex-col`.
3. The list panel uses `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-hidden` so it always occupies the remaining height.
4. The direct table container or an element marked `data-slot="operational-list-body"` owns vertical scrolling.
5. Do not use hard-coded `calc(100vh - ...)` values. They break under browser zoom, different headers, and responsive wrapping.
6. Do not let `body` or the whole page become the table scroll container.
7. Pagination must be a direct, non-scrolling child of the list panel.

## Header, toolbar, and filters

- Keep the list title, result count, search, and common filters in the non-scrolling top region.
- When there are only one or two simple filters, show their `Select`/`NativeSelect` controls directly in the toolbar.
- Use a filter sheet only when the filter set is too large for the toolbar or contains advanced dependent fields.
- Changing search, filters, or page size resets the current page to `1`.
- Toolbar controls must wrap on narrow screens without causing horizontal page overflow.

## Table behavior

- Use the shared shadcn `Table` components.
- Table header cells use `sticky top-0 z-10 bg-card`.
- Long text is truncated only when the full value remains available through a detail link or tooltip.
- Mobile layouts may switch to an item list, but the item-list wrapper must use `data-slot="operational-list-body"` so it receives the same flexible scrolling behavior.
- Empty, loading, and error states must occupy the flexible body area rather than collapsing the panel.

## Pagination

- Use `OperationalPagination` for list screens.
- The default choices are `10`, `20`, `30`, and `50` rows per page.
- `page` and `pageSize` belong to the page/container component and must be sent to paginated APIs.
- “Select all” applies only to the currently visible page unless the UI explicitly confirms selecting all filtered results.

## Accessibility

- Every list panel needs `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
- Search and filter controls need visible labels or `aria-label`.
- Icon-only actions need an accessible name and tooltip where helpful.
- Sticky headers, keyboard focus, status text, and row actions must remain usable at 200% browser zoom.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Page root fills available height and includes `min-h-0`.
- [ ] Page root and all workspace ancestors use `w-full min-w-0` without a centered `max-w-*` wrapper.
- [ ] List panel uses `OperationalListPanel`.
- [ ] Header and toolbar do not scroll with rows.
- [ ] Only the list/table body scrolls vertically.
- [ ] Pagination stays at the bottom with few and many rows.
- [ ] No fixed viewport-height calculation is duplicated in the feature.
- [ ] Simple filters are directly accessible in the toolbar.
- [ ] Layout works at narrow desktop widths and common zoom levels.
